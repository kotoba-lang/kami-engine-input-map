  "input-map — device-neutral input mapping (ADR-0037 seam #3).

  Restored from `kami-script-runtime`'s `src/input_map.rs` (legacy Rust
  workspace deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82, recoverable at commit
  a8368f9c0d784dbc9d11e8fa8f407aa95c7ce4fa). Ported per ADR-2607010930, the
  standing policy for restoring deleted Rust crates as zero-dependency
  portable `.cljc`.

  The original module's own doc comment justifies this specific restoration:
  input_map.rs is 'device-neutral input mapping... in pure Rust... This
  module has no platform deps and is fully unit-tested' — a self-contained
  pure-math module (touch-to-axis virtual-stick mapping, radial dead-zone
  clamping, button press/release edge detection) that happens to live inside
  an otherwise-substrate crate.

  IMPORTANT — scoping: this repo ports ONLY input_map.rs. The REST of
  kami-script-runtime — `lib.rs`, `platform.rs`, `bin/*` — is the actual WASM
  host (wasmtime JIT, or wasmi when no JIT is available) that binds the
  `kami:engine/*` component-model imports to live Rust game-engine state.
  That is genuine substrate with no portable CLJC representation, and this
  project's CLAUDE.md / ADR-2607010930 explicitly excludes it from
  restoration. It is NOT ported here, and never will be.

  The game only ever asks the abstract `kami:engine/input` surface for
  *named* actions: `(axis \"MoveX\")`, `(key-down? \"Fire\")`. Each
  platform's raw devices — touch sticks (iOS / Android), DualSense (PS5),
  Joy-Con / Pro (Switch), MFi (iOS) — are translated into that surface
  *here*, in pure data + functions, so the same guest logic runs on all of
  them unchanged.

  Two device shapes a non-keyboard platform needs:
    - [[stick]] / [[axes]]           — an on-screen thumbstick fed a raw touch point.
    - [[apply-dead-zone]]            — radial dead zone + clamp for a physical analog stick.

  Plus edge detection for buttons:
    - [[button-edges]] / [[update]]  — press/release edges from a per-frame held set.

  Both stick mappings produce an `[x y]` pair in `[-1, 1]` with **y up**
  (screen-y grows down, so it is negated), ready to drop into two named
  axes."

(defn stick
  "A circular on-screen thumbstick centred at `center` (`[x y]`) with the
  given travel `radius` in pixels and a 15% dead zone — a sane default for a
  touch thumbstick.

  A touch within `radius` of `center` becomes a clamped `[-1, 1]` axis pair;
  touches inside the dead zone (a fraction of the radius) read as zero so a
  resting thumb does not drift the character."

  Returns `[0 0]` inside the dead zone. Beyond `radius` the magnitude clamps
  to 1 (further travel doesn't over-drive the axis). Output past the dead
  zone is rescaled so the usable range starts cleanly at 0, giving smooth
  control right at the dead-zone edge instead of a jump."

  zone and clamps the magnitude to the unit circle. Inside `dead` (a

  also wants the down-edge for `(key-pressed? \"Jump\")`. [[update]] computes
  that edge host-side so `key-down?` (level) and `key-pressed?` (edge) read
  identically on every target. Pure state, no platform deps."
